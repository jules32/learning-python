## Observations as I try to learn Python

- You'll need to install Python along with other things to create the proper environment. Additionally, you'll write your code in a separate file, a script with a .py file extension. This is done in separate software, a Text Editor like TextWrangler, Atom, etc. Then, with the proper environment setup, you can execute/run the .py code.
- The environment includes modules/packages/libraries, and can be a bit complex. You can also save environments with the setup you like, or you can also install environments created by the community, such as "conda" or "miniconda".
- You often create the environment from/in the Command Line. This means that to use Python you also need to know the Command Line.
- Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Notebooks to interactively write and run code. If you launch Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda, the environment is already setup for you! And, you can execute code from within the notebook, meaning you don't need to interact with the Command Line.
- Many folks use a combination: they will develop workflows interactively in Juypter Notebooks and then put it in a .py script when it is quite developed, which they can run more broadly
- No matter your setup, many tutorials and StackOverflow messages assume you are using the Command Line setup, so you will have to navigate through these, learn, and adapt them for
